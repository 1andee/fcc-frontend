      <p>Robert A. 'Bob' Hoover is a pilot of legendary proportions, having been an Army Air Force pilot, a POW who escaped in a stolen German aircraft, military and civilian test pilot, and airshow pilot. He and his familiar North American P-51 and Rockwell Shrike Commander 500S were seen by millions at airshows from the 1950s through the 1990s.
